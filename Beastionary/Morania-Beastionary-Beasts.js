The now Magic Slime felt strong and attacked the magician but the magician dodge and in fear ran away. The magic slime ventured far and wide all who dared fight it were defeated or ran away. Eventually it fell into a deep dark hole and couldnt find an immediat exit so it ventured further. it reached the bottom and at the bottom was a very dark gem that was darker then dark, blacker then black, it seemed to negate color all around it was shadowed by darkness, it was so dark that even light couldnt get near it. The Magic Slime got close to the Dark Gem. The dark gem like a magnet shot towards the slime... the slime couldnt dodge. The slime enveloped the Dark Gem and became the Dark-Gem Slime.",
