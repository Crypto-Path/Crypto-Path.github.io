createGroup("Plans for Morania", "Morania plans to be a MMORPG with Advanced Combat that relys mostly on user skill other than the normal leveling system. if you were just thrown into another world with with goblins and ghouls you wouldnt just be able to kill a million rats and start 1 shotting gods, you may be tougher than you were when you started but not by much. The hard difficulty and the advanced combat make this game more suttable to multiplayer but for you massochists there is singleplayer, in multi there will be a party system where you can sort out your party and say who will do what... or... just... Group up and hit it till it dies...");

createGroup("Advanced Combat","For the Advanced Combat you click in the direction you want to attack, right click in the direction you want to block, and middle click to roll. the 3 main combat options are the basics there are also skills that users can use. skills will take a long time to learn and get good at using during combat (most enemys and boss cant be defeated by just attacking blocking and dodging(or else every enemy will be like a dark souls boss and bosses will just be impossible))");
